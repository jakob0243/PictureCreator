Take a data set of images and assign a colour to each of these images based on average colour in image
and save it as a dictionary or something, mapping colour value to img name.

Tasks:
    -   Iterate over directory and load each image into memory then get rid of it, should return list of names
    -   When image is loaded in it avg the colour values of each pixel and map it to the name
